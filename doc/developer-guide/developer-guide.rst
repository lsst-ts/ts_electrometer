The Electrometer is a standard salobj CSC.
It communicates over ethernet, but using a serial-to-ethernet converter.

`Docushare collection <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-5176>`_

Device Setup
============

The electrometer uses an RS-232 serial connection as it's primary communication method.
It is connected to a Moxa Nport 5110 ethernet to serial converter, which is what the CSC connects to.

We use the following serial connection settings:

- Baud Rate = 57.6 K
- Flow control = XON/XOFF
- Terminator = <CR>
- Parity = None
- Stop bits = 1

Electrometer
------------

.. important::
    The RS-232 serial connection between the electrometer and moxa converter requires a straight-through male/female cable, and *not* a null modem connection.
    Cable lengths should be minimized.

The electrometer and photodiode documentation is found `on Docushare <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-5176>`_.
The devices must also have their serial/RS-232 communications configured to the proper parameters. 
Directions on how to do so for the electrometer are found on `page X of the user manual <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-25236/6517B-900-01_A.pdf>`_.
The parameters which must be set are:

- Baud Rate = 57.6 K
- Flow control = XON/XOFF
- Terminator = <CR>



Moxa Serial-to-Ethernet converter
---------------------------------

The moxa Nport 5110 manual is `on Docushare <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-38658/moxa-nport-ia5000-series-manual-v4.0.pdf>`_.

Setting up these devices for the first time is a bit tricky, follow the steps closely.

#. Request a DHCP IP reservation from IT corresponding to the MAC address on the back of the device.
#. Plug in to network and connect to a power source. 
   The moxa device will try to connect to 192.168.127.XX (see address on the back of device).
   On the office network, nothing will ping the device and therefore it will not report anything back and therefore will not receive an IP automatically and therefore will look like it can't communicate. 
   This is because there is no device on the same subnet.

#. From a device on the same network (running linux), add a second IP:

   ``sudo ip a add 192.168.127.10/24 dev eth0``

#. Then ping the entire subnet. 

   ``ping 192.168.127.254``  
   This will make it such that the moxa device comes online, but with a 192.168.127.254 IP address.

#. On the same device you used to ping it, open a web browser and navigate to: 

   ``192.168.127.254/main.htm``
   Then login to the web-API and the device settings can be applied.

#. The basic settings can be left as the defaults, as shown in the following figure, but a name can be added if desired.

   .. figure:: _static/moxa_basic_settings.png
      :name: Moxa NPort Basic Settings
      :alt: Moxa basic settings

      Adding a name is optional, but recommended.

#. The serial settings should be as follows, and as shown in the following figure.
   - baud 57.6k, data bits 8, stop 1, parity non, FIFO enabled, flow ctrl xon/off, interface rs-232

   .. figure:: _static/moxa_serial_settings.png
      :name: Moxa NPort Serial Settings
      :alt: Moxa serial settings

      The serial settings must match the electrometer settings.

.. important::
    Before continuing, make sure to have a reserved IP from IT for the Moxa's MAC address.

#. The operating settings should be in tcp server mode, with the following settings:

   .. figure:: _static/moxa_network_settings.png
      :name: Moxa NPort Network Settings
      :alt: Moxa network settings

      When the IP configuration is set to DHCP, and the setting is saved, the device will reset and automatically populate the gateway, netmask and others, also grabbing the assigned IP.

Once the electrometer is configured, the following code can be used to verify functionality.

.. code-block:: python

    import socket
    import time
    HOST="140.252.147.109"; PORT=4001
    s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((HOST, PORT))
    time.sleep(0.5)
    # After the following command, a "REM" will appear on the electrometer LED screen.
    s.sendall(f'*idn?\r'.encode())
    # Pause here to ensure all data gets written to the buffer
    time.sleep(0.5)
    data=s.recv(1024*2)
    print(f'data is: {data}')

This should return:
